# VisualTez

`VisualTez` is a visual programming tool for writing smart contracts in the Tezos blockchain.

The VisualTez project lets people describe smart contracts through illustrations that can be built by simply dragging and dropping blocks. Text-based programming languages are usually difficult for people without a computer science background or similar.
